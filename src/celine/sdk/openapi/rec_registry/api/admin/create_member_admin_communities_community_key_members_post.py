    Answers `409` when the key or `user_id` is already taken, naming the
    existing key so a caller can switch to `PATCH`. It does not overwrite: the
    caller asked to create, and silently updating somebody else's row is how a
    retry with a changed payload rewrites the wrong person.

    A concurrent create answers `409` too — the unique index refuses it, and the
    service translates that back into the same conflict.

    An `active` member created with meters is `409 sensor_held` when another
    active member, in any community, holds one of their sensors (REQ-0069),
    and one created with delivery points is `409 delivery_point_held` when
    another active member holds one of those (REQ-0085).
    An asset key longer than 128 characters is `422 asset_key_too_long`
    (REQ-0028).

    `role` and `status` outside their sets are `422 invalid_role` /
    `invalid_status`, and an `area` that is not a key of the community's
    areas is `422 unknown_area` (REQ-0066).
